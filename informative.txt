1871, Los Angeles
a mob walked in, attacked, robbed, assaulted all residents
on all blocks, not one shop not visited
the biggest mass lynching
in American history
and the victims, they were not black, they were not white, they were like me, with my skin, and they were all tied
by their necks 'til they either snapped or suffocated
all they had worked for ransacked and taken
and meanwhile, all they ever knew growing up was miles and miles and miles and miles away from them
and what about Rock Springs, the Exclusion Act, and the internment camps
and Watsonville and Murphy Ranch?
and all the hurt the white man made us endure? but nah, nah, nah,
